        <h2>San Francisco Street Art as a Canvas for Change</h2>
        <h3>By: Libby Raymond, Eleni Tecos, Eliza Tucker</h3>

                <p>Stepping into the heart of San Francisco’s Mission District, one can not help but notice the murals lining the streets. Some sun-faded and battered by years of weather, 
                    others still vibrant and exploding with colors, the murals extend above storefronts, down alleys and across the garage doors of homes. What they all have in common are the stories they tell of culture, pain and resistance in the local community.</p>
                    <p>Public-facing arts — murals, mosaics and other works on the streets and buildings of San Francisco — have long served as a canvas for political expression, beginning in the 1970s 
                      with immigrant communities protesting U.S. involvement in Central America by painting community murals in the Mission District. Today, public-facing arts continue to address injustice, with many artists calling attention to the genocide in Gaza. From the Mission District’s earliest 
                      murals to today’s urgent cries for justice, public-facing art is a compelling tool used to fight back against injustice. 
                  </p>

          <!--THE MISSIONS LEGACY-->

                <div class="text-content">
                    <h4>The Mission's Legacy</h4>
                    <p>One of the hallmark institutions of public-facing arts of San Francisco is Precita Eyes Muralists, a community-based, inner-city mural arts organization dedicated 
                        to mural creation, preservation and education. Founded in 1977, Precita Eyes offers walking tours through some of the most famous murals in the Mission.
                    </p>
                
                <div class="image-container">
                  <img src="MuralPics-08.jpg" alt="Precita Eyes Building in the Mission District">
                </div>
                <p>The murals of the Mission have a rich history dating back to the 1970s, when the first pieces began popping up in Balmy Alley – regarded by long-time muralist and Precita Eyes tour guide Patricia Rose as the original mural alley. Many of the earliest murals addressed political strife in Central America, as civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua prompted mass immigration to San Francisco. Each minute detail of the murals in Balmy Alley serves as a reminder of a collective history of repression and retaliation that refuses to be forgotten.
                </p>
                <p>“I’ve been doing this for, I don’t know, 50 years or more. And, unfortunately, these issues don’t seem to go away,” said Juana Alicia, a long-time artist and activist within the Chicano Art Movement. Her most famous pieces include: Las Lechugueras, Ceasefire/Alto Al Fuego and MAESTRAPEACE.</p>
                <div class="image-container">
                  <img src="MuralPics-04.jpg" alt="Juana ALicias Mural 'La Llorona's Sacred Waters'">
                </div>
                <p>Alicia, whose murals can be seen in California, Pennsylvania, Nicaragua and Mexico – where she is now located – often draws inspiration from current events. By working through intersectional lenses such as decolonization, feminism and indigenous identity, Alicia sees her art as a way to confront issues within the communities that surround her.
                </p>
                <p>“We have to spend our energy carefully,” said Alicia. “For me, art – my artwork – is the way that I can deal with the political repression that we’ve suffered throughout the history of the United States – against women, against people of color, against immigrants, against non-binary people, against gay people, against disabled people.”

    <!-- SF VOICES FOR GAZA -->
          <div class="content-section">
                <div class="text-content">
                    <h4>SF Voices For Gaza</h4>
                    <p>Public-facing arts continue to act as powerful tools of protest, with shifting – yet urgent – themes. Recently, San Francisco housed a new wave of art that challenges the ongoing genocide in Gaza. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Artists like Dottie Lux have turned to using their art as a means of expressing the pain and outrage felt by Palestinians. Through her platform, Lux challenges the status quo, even if it means stepping away from the commercial success more palatable art may bring.
                    </p>
                    <p>“For me, it really boils down to two things: whether you want to be willing to use your art to say something, or if you’re fully relying on your art to make money,” said Lux, who recently curated a multi-sensory exhibit transforming art into essential funds for families in Gaza. “I have been a performance artist for over 20 years, and for most of my career, I’ve used my voice to be cheeky or funny or appealing – very commercial. But since October of 2023, I didn’t really feel like I had that luxury anymore.” 
                    </p>
                    <p>In 2024, Lux spent three months in the West Bank, serving as protective presence for Palestinian families with the International Solidarity Movement. Her time there greatly influenced the exhibit, which featured photography, paintings and a soundscape enshrouding visitors within the experience of a demolition by Israeli soldiers. And yet, Lux said there is still more work to be done.
                    </p>
                    <p>“We are doing the very most that we possibly can, and it is still the least that we can do,” said Lux.
                    </p>
                    <p>Another artist, Palestinian-American Chris Gazaleh, has been creating art that raises awareness about the history, people and struggle for freedom in Palestine for years, beginning with graffiti letters in his youth and later moving to mural arts at 21 years-old. His practice has earned him a wall in Clarion Alley, which has been his practice since 2012.</p>

    <!-- SANITIZED EXPRESSION -->
    <div class="content-section">
          <div class="text-content">
            <h4>Sanitized Expression</h4>
            <p>San Francisco, a city known for its convergence of outspoken political activism and vibrant arts, continues to push the boundaries of the conventional through its public-facing arts. Yet, the tension between artistic expression and political protest remains a thin line.
              </p>
              <p> While the murals of the Mission District are public-facing, those with political motivations are privately owned. As per the San Francisco Arts Commission, publicly-funded art, which is often publicly available, cannot be political. 
              </p>
              <p>“San Francisco is not tearing down anti-Zionist work or anything like that, but they’re going in the back door…to promote art that is more digestible,” Lux said
              </p>
          </div>
      </div>
      
      <!-- HANDS OF RESISTANCE -->
      <div class="content-section">
        <div class="text-content">
          <h4>Hands of Resistance</h4>
          <p>Despite these challenges, the power of public-facing art to express a range of sentiments, from dissent to appreciation, is undeniable. In the Mission, where murals have long served as an outlet for expression, art still speaks loudly–about hope, about history and about change. One such mural in the Mission depicts two hands coming together – an image of unity and strength.
          </p>
          <p>Tribute to Archbishop Oscar Romero honors the teachings and legacy of the fourth archbishop of El Salvador who was assassinated in 1980. According to Rose, the memorial urges people to follow his teachings, which would be to get to work to make change.
          </p>
          <p>“The biggest element in the mural is the two hands because those are the tools we all get to get started with,” Rose said. “We get one on the end of each arm, but to really change the world, everybody has to work toward it, so we have a group of people in the center to remind us of that.”
          </p>
          <p>The mural’s message is clear: our work is far from finished, and the fight for justice is ours to tackle through community. Public-facing art remains a crucial element of that fight, unflinching in its call for change and permanently enshrined along the walls of San Francisco.
